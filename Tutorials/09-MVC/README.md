# MVC (Model View Controller)

## Is MVC still actual?

Short answer: yes.


## Rendering of part of HTML page

Besides whole HTML pages, you can render any HTML code for already rendered HTML page, herewith this HTML code is intended
to be requested via [AJAX](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_ajax_intro.asp) and mounted to [DOM](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp)
by JavaScript.

Return to out example. Assume that once we have retrieved the whole HTML page, we want to retrieve new data which will be 
displayed by cards without page reloading.
